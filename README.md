Personal website that (probably) is written in MEAN
## Intial Plan
We'll probably just have a very simple landing page
that has a picture of my dumb face, links to my blog,
linkedin, and maybe I'll set up an instagram or something
for pictures. I should also link my google scholar page for
funsies
## Technology
Seeing as how I've never done full stack before, I think using
MEAN would be super dope. Just gotta figure out... ya know...
how to do that.
