Personal website that (probably) is currently just in HTML5 (sorta).
## Intial Plan
We'll probably just have a very simple landing page
that has a picture of my dumb face, links to my blog,
linkedin, and maybe I'll set up an instagram or something
for pictures. I should also link my google scholar page for funsies
## Technology
Using the HTML5 boilerplate. Because when I googled 
boilerplate and webpage it was the first thing that 
popped up.
