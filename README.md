## Hello There ✌️

I'm Dave and this is my swanky GitHub profile. I guess that's actually redundant.

### About Me

* I used to be a theoretical chemist
    * Now I'm not (though if you wanna see what I used to do click [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Fs839DwAAAAJ&hl=en))
* I like data, especially when it's big
* I think security is neat and important

### None-Code Crap I Do

* Wrench on my car/motorcycle
* Make espresso
* Think about plants
* Look at plants
* Read books about plants
* Go hiking
