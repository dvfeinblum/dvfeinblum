            I'm dave feinblum (which, given the url, you probs already knew).
            As you can see, I'm no front end engineer, so apologies for the... sparseness.
            It's a bit post modern for my taste but these sorts of sites are in vogue now, right?
            <br><br>
            Anyway, I've got some links to other stuff you can click if you wanna know more about me.
            It literally took me like two hours to get that little menu on the left to behave so like, 
            click something? Also I changed the colors of the links when you hover over 'em how neat is that?
